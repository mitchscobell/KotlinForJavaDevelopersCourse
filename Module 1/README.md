# Module 1

## What is Kotlin?

- General Purpose program language
- OOP + Functional Programming (FP)
- Static typing
- Open Source (Apache 2.0)
- Developed by JetBrains and community
- Concise
- Safe
- Interoperable and can reuse all of Java
- Tool-friendly since JetBrains is a tooling company
- Deliberately not a research project, made for industry
- Learned from Java, Scala, C#, Groovy, Python, C, C++, Objective-C, Delphi, etc...
- Pragmatist first: Elegance is great as long as it's pragmatic

## Android & Server & Target Platforms

- Android isn't all that Kotlin is for
- Server side can be also used
- JVM
- JS
- Native
- Can write a full-stack operation and it be used anywhere and share the business logic and common code

## History

- 2010 Project Started
- 2016 Kotlin 1.0
- 2017 official on Android (became a first class citizen) boosted adoption
- 2018 Kotlin 1.3

### Why

Not an easy decision but humanity gets better ideas for new languages. Have to create an ecosystem so it's not easy.
On the other hand, it isn't always easy to add to old languages.
Java developers need a better programming experience. Wanted to improve it for themselves and community.

### Who Develops Kolin

- JetBrains, most beneficial to have a centralized language design
- Kotlin Language Committee, double checks that the language is compatible from one version to another.
- One big release a year, between smaller point updates, improvements, bug fixes, etc.
